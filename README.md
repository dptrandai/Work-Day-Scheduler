# Work-Day-Scheduler

This application is designed to be a daily planner. The user should be able to input their daily tasks in specified time blocks. Once the task is added, they can save the task. After saving, the user should be able to refresh and revisit the page with all the saved data from the local storage. 

The time blocks are from 9:00AM-5:00PM
